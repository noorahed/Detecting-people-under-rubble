# Detecting-people-under-rubble
This project focuses on developing a deep learning solution to detect people trapped under rubble using fused thermal and RGB imagery. Leveraging the power of **YOLOv8**, the system aims to assist in **disaster recovery scenarios** by providing real-time object detection in challenging environments.
